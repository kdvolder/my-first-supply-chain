This folder contains files related to carrying out the 'kpack' tutorial from here:

https://github.com/pivotal/kpack/blob/main/docs/tutorial.md

We are going into that tutorial because we are having problems with the cartographer tutorial.
I suspect the problem is something to do with kpack / builds malfunctioning in the example.
But havng ot much of an idea of how kpack works or how to trouble-shoot what is wrong
with my example... I concluded it would be a good idea to first go down the
kpack rabithole and try understand that in isolation.
